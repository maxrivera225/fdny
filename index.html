            <h4>September 7, 2023</h4>
            
			<p class="intro"> <p><span>BROOKLYN, NY --</span>The names of 43 fallen members of the Fire Department were added to the World Trade Center memorial wall at FDNY headquarters on Wednesday. The FDNY members honored are part of an ever-growing group who sacrificed, or continue to sacrifice, after responding to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, said the FDNY commissioner, Laura Kavanagh.
			</p>
			<p>
				She was joined at the ceremony by Mayor Eric Adams, high-ranking FDNY officials and family members. 
			</p>
			<p>The names added to the memorial wall in Brooklyn were of members who died in 2022 and the first half of 2023 of 9/11-related illnesses. Included were six members who died over seven days in September of 2022. Among that group was Battalion Chief Stephen Geraghty, who served the department for 41 years. </p>
			<p>The death toll of FDNY members lost to 9/11 related illnesses sits at 331, nearly surpassing the 343 members that the department lost on September 11th. Cancer experts expect this number to continue to climb. More people have died in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as a result of a World Trade Center health program certified illnesses, than in the actual attacks, according to the CDC.</p>
			<p> “True heroes of incredible character,” said FDNY Chief of Department, John Hodgens. Hodgens praised the members that responded to the terrorist attacks as more than mere rescue workers. They gave New Yorkers a chance to heal, he said. </p>
			<p>Mayor Eric Adams joined a chorus of voices across the 90-minute ceremony encouraging everyone to remember not only September 11th, but also September 12th and beyond. </p>
			<p>Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, one of the FDNY’s chaplains, led the ceremony in prayer to emphasize the importance of “the day after.”</p>
			<p>“Because what you do the day after shows how sincere you were the day before,” he said.</p>
			<p>Adams stood by the commissioner throughout the ceremony, appearing to offer unwavering support, despite well-documented, ongoing turmoil among high-ranking chiefs and Kavanagh.</p>
			<p>Kavanagh, the first woman to serve as commissioner of the FDNY, has held numerous roles within her 10-year tenure with the department, but never that of firefighter.</p>
			<p>It took nearly 15 minutes to read all 43 names. Each name read was followed by the sound of a single bell, the last alarm for these fallen members. Family members were invited to place a rose on a table in front of the memorial wall. The pile of white roses, representing the lives lost, quickly covered every visible inch of the table. </p>
			<p>Jesse Scaduto placed a rose for his mother, Patricia Scaduto, who served as an EMT for nearly 35 years, long enough to have been on the job for both attacks on the World Trade Center, in 1993 and 2001. </p>
			<p>When the ceremony ended, many of the family members who placed roses near the names of their loved ones returned to take pictures of the newly added names; a digital keepsake, not unlike the pencil rubbing of the  9/11 plaques first unveiled over 20 years ago.
